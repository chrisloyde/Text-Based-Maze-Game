Text-Based-Maze-Game
This program is designed for more advanced coders, either as a final project to the intro level
class or an early project in the class following the intro level. This program requires an
understanding of object oriented programming, 2D arrays, and file processing, so students
should have already been assigned projects dealing with these topics individually before
tackling this one. This program will help further students understanding of object oriented
programming by allowing them to experiment with it in a “fun” way. It may be very beneficial to a
student’s understanding of OOP when they think of objects as tangible objects in a game world
rather than abstract data manipulation tools. This is a good project because a lot of students get
into the Computer Science major in hopes of getting into game development, and this allows
students to experiment with game development and respect the complexities of it.
